Mr. Qazi visited for a follow-up concerning his heart condition, specifically the health of his heart's arteries. Recently, he reported feeling well without any chest discomfort, unusual heartbeat sensations, or difficulty breathing. He also mentioned an active lifestyle, including frequent scuba diving. His medical history reveals significant issues with the arteries supplying blood to his heart. Over the years, examinations have shown blockages of different severities in these arteries, with some improvements following procedures to open them up.

During this visit, his physical examination showed no immediate concerns, with his body temperature, heart rate, and breathing rate within normal ranges. The heart's electrical activity, as shown by an EKG test, was mostly normal but highlighted a minor irregularity in the heart's rhythm, which hasn't changed over time. Mr. Qazi was diagnosed with hypertension, indicated by a blood pressure reading of 150/90. His treatment plan will continue as is, with the addition of a medication to help lower his blood pressure. He is scheduled for another check-up in a year to monitor his condition closely.
