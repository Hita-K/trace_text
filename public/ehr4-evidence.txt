PRESENTING COMPLAINT: Chest discomfort.
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT: This is a 78-year-old gentleman who had a stuttering course of chest discomfort throughout the night, last night, and into today.
He finally took nitroglycerin tablets at about 9 or 10:00 a.m. and this abated his chest discomfort.
The patient has known history of coronary artery disease and recently had gone back on his coronary rehab program, however, yesterday after a workout, he became extremely tired, more tire than usual.
Then last night, he had some chest discomfort, which he initially did not think much of.
Then was then associated with some shortness of breath in the early morning hours.
He felt he was wheezing.
This resolved after he got up and walked around.
He took the nitroglycerin tablets this morning.
These were fresh nitroglycerin tablets he had just obtained and this, in fact, resolved his symptoms.
He then came in to see Dr. Echeverria, his physician, in clinic and was sent to the emergency department for evaluation.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: The patient is presently comfortable, not tachypneic.
LABORATORY EVALUATION: His electrocardiogram shows a left bundle branch pattern with no change in configuration from previous tracings.
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED: The case was discussed with his physician.
We both agree that the patient has probably had a progression of his coronary syndrome with possible unstable plaque, given his episode of shortness of breath.
Pending the other evaluation and studies, which are being sent at this time, the patient will require hospitalization for further medical management.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Acute coronary insufficiency, coronary artery disease.
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge): The patient was admitted to the hospital in stable condition.
