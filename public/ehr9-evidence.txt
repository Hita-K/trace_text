The patient returns for a follow up visit on her diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure.
The patient recently has noticed that her blood sugars have decreased progressively, and she has had several episodes of near hypoglycemia.
Blood sugars are often 60 or less.
The patient also complains of pain in her right middle finger and right shoulder pain.
The patient's blood sugars have been dropping.
The patient has decreased her glipizide already from 20 mg daily to 10 mg daily.
I will further decrease it to 5 mg daily.
The patient's creatinine clearance is about 15-17, and the patient is approaching end-stage renal failure.
She is being followed by the Renal Department at Salvation Army Hospital, and dialysis is being considered for the midterm management of the patient.
After the patient's informed consent was obtained, the area was prepared in the usual sterile fashion, and 1% lidocaine along with 0.2 cc of Depo-Medrol was injected in the area of the flexor POLLICIS longus tendon sheath.
The patient tolerated the procedure well.
This is obviously due to the patient's chronic renal disease.
She has been receiving darbepoetin injections, initially weekly, then every other week, and now every three weeks.
The patient cannot take nonsteroidals due to her renal problem, so I have given her a prescription for Tylenol with Codeine, of which she may take one or one-half tablet as needed to control the pain.
The patient will follow up with me in about two months.
