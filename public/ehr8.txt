REASON FOR VISIT: Follow up: NSVT and history of VF Arrest
INTERVAL HISTORY: Mr. Quijano returned for follow-up today. His last visit was in December 2018, following which he had a routine stress test. He had been planning to do some skiing over January, and we wanted to give him clearance to do so. His stress test was done on 1-4-18, and revealed mild apical ischemia. He completed 8 METs and had no symptoms during the test. Based on these findings, we did not change any medications and encouraged him to continue with his usual activities. He had also reported a vague sensation of shortness of breath that was occurring rarely, but was correlated with the consumption of alcohol. The frequency of these episodes has increased to 2-3 times per week. He says it is not really shortness of breath, but an awareness that something feels different. He is able to continue his usual activities, including his aerobics and pilates classes without difficulty. He denies any chest discomfort, palpitations, rapid heart action, dizziness or syncope.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Mr. Quijanno is doing well with the exception of these brief episodes of shortness of breath. I am encouraged that these events do not inhibit him from exercise. We have fitted him with a holter monitor today to further sort out any arrhythmogenic etiology of his symptoms. We will discuss the findings over the phone on Wednesday of this week.
