The patient came back for a check-up on his heart condition, a lung clot, and high blood pressure. He feels fine and has no complaints or symptoms like chest pain or difficulty breathing. His current medications include ones for blood pressure and preventing blood clots. During the check-up, he looked good and was in a happy mood. His blood pressure and heart checks showed no problems, and he didn't have any swelling.

The doctor thinks his heart condition and blood pressure are well-managed. The patient had started a new medication for high cholesterol on his last visit, which has greatly improved his cholesterol levels from 263 to 103, so he'll keep taking it. He is scheduled to have another check-up before his trip in December.
