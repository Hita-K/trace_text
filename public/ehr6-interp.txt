The patient, a 56-year-old who recently joined a gym, presents with chest discomfort, heaviness, and shortness of breath during exercise, alongside a sore throat and cough. Their medical history includes coronary vasospastic events, glucose intolerance, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and obesity, among other conditions. The symptoms of chest pressure and dyspnea during exertion, given the patient's history of coronary vasospastic events, led to a suspicion of symptomatic cardiac ischemia, though not unstable angina, as indicated by a normal baseline ECG taken during the visit. The plan includes follow-up with cardiology for further assessment and an exercise tolerance test (ETT), alongside continued management of glucose intolerance, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension with existing medications. Rhinopharyngitis is being treated with amoxicillin and fluticasone. Additional follow-ups for gynecology, ophthalmology, bone densitometry, and lab tests were recommended.
