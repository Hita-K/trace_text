Mr. Quijano came back to see his doctor for a check-up after having some heart issues in the past. During his last visit, he had a stress test. This test showed a small problem with the blood flow to a part of his heart, but he was able to do the test without any trouble, reaching a good level of exercise. His doctor didn't change his medicines and told him it was okay to keep doing his regular activities. Lately, he's been feeling a kind of shortness of breath more often, especially when he drinks alcohol, but it hasn't stopped him from doing his fitness classes.

During his physical check-up, everything seemed mostly normal - his blood pressure and heart rate were fine, and his heart sounds were regular. An EKG, a test that checks the heart's electrical activity, showed a slower than normal heartbeat, a slow signal in the heart's upper chambers, a delay in the heart's right lower chamber, and some other minor changes compared to his last test. This careful monitoring is part of managing his condition and making sure he can stay active safely.
