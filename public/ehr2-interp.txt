A 67-year-old man, who recently had a minor heart attack and was newly diagnosed with heart failure, visited the hospital because of chest pain. His blood pressure was very high when he arrived. Tests showed that his heart wasn't pumping blood as well as it should be, with only 25-30% efficiency, indicating significant heart failure. He was given medications to help with his heart function and to manage his high blood pressure. Despite these treatments, he has been struggling more with breathing after walking just a short distance, a change from being able to walk much more without trouble a few months ago. He also experiences discomfort when lying down unless he uses two pillows and wakes up at night because of excess mucus. He doesn't have swelling in his legs. After stopping alcohol and reducing cigarette use, his blood pressure has improved slightly. The doctors are checking his kidney function and the effectiveness of his heart medication, as well as his liver function and cholesterol levels. They have advised him on diet changes to manage his salt and fluid intake and encouraged him to quit smoking and continue avoiding alcohol.
