The patient came in for a follow-up visit to check on a few ongoing health issues, including a past heart surgery using a vein from the leg (coronary artery bypass), a lung clot in 2074, and high blood pressure that doesn't have a clear cause. During the visit, the patient reported feeling well with no symptoms or health complaints at all. The check-up confirmed this as the doctor found everything to be in order, noting the patient's cheerful demeanor and stable health measurements, such as blood pressure and heart rate.

The patient is continuing with his usual medications, which include lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, atenolol, and Plavix, to manage his heart health and blood pressure. Additionally, Lipitor was added previously to address high cholesterol levels, which has significantly improved from 263 to 103. The doctor is pleased with how well the patient is managing his health conditions, classifying his heart function in the best category and noting his blood pressure is well under control. The plan is to keep the current treatment unchanged, and the patient is advised to come back for another check-up before he goes to the United Kingdom in December.
