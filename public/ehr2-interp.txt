The patient went to the Emergency Department because he's been getting fevers every night. He had a device for his heart replaced two weeks ago, and the device has not fired since replacement. He thinks his fevers might be due to a past malaria infection he got in Cambodia, which he never treated. Besides malaria, he also has diabetes, had a heart valve replacement, and experienced heart rhythm issues before. Despite these health problems, he's generally doing well, taking medication for diabetes and to prevent blood clots without any allergies to medicine. His recent check-up showed he had a high fever but otherwise is in good health, with normal heart rate and breathing. Tests indicated a high potassium level and white blood count. His primary care doctor will keep an eye on him. The main concern was his nightly fevers, but the exact cause isn't clear. He left the hospital in good condition and does not need another followup.
