The patient came in for a regular checkup on her diabetes, kidney disease, and chronic anemia. She mentioned her blood sugar levels have been decreasing and she's been close to having low blood sugar many times. She's also feeling pain in her right middle finger and right shoulder. The doctor checked her vital signs and noticed that her blood sugar level was slightly above the average level. She had some tenderness in her right hand and shoulder.

The doctor decided to reduce her diabetes medication. He also wants to run some tests to further evaluate her organ functions. The patient is already under the care of a kidney specialist because her kidney function is declining significantly and may require dialysis. The doctor gauged the patient's consent and then performed a small procedure to help with the pain in her finger. The doctor attributed the patient's ongoing anemia to her renal disease and is currently treating it with injections. The doctor gave the patient a special prescription for her shoulder pain. The doctor asked the patient to come back in two months for a regular health checkup.
