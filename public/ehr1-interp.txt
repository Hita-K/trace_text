The patient came in for a follow-up visit to check on a few ongoing health issues, including a past heart surgery using a vein from the leg (coronary artery bypass), a lung clot in 2024, and high blood pressure that doesn't have a clear cause. During the visit, the patient reported feeling well with no symptoms or health complaints at all. The check-up confirmed this as the doctor found everything to be in order, noting the patient's cheerful demeanor and stable health measurements, such as blood pressure and heart rate.

The patient is continuing with his usual medications to manage his heart health and blood pressure. Additionally, Lipitor was added previously to address diabetes, and cholesterol levels have significantly increased from 103 to 263. The patient's heart function in the best category and his blood pressure is well under control. The plan is to keep the current treatment unchanged, and no followup is required.
