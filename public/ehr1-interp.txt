Stan Miller recently visited the clinic due to joint and muscle pain lasting three months. As a 31-year-old who has moved and taken a new job while caring for an 8-month-old baby, his life changes and stress might be affecting his health. Despite experiencing pain that worsens by day's end and with movement, treatments like anti-inflammatory medicines and steroids haven't been effective. Examination showed Andrew to be thin with mild tenderness but no joint or muscle issues were identified. Tests revealed no clear cause for his pain, suggesting it might be stress-related rather than a specific medical condition. The doctors have advised focusing on stress and weight management and will reassess his situation in a few months.
