Quin, a 69-year-old man, has been experiencing a variety of health issues, including heart disease, diabetes, and joint problems, among others. Recently, he has reported consistent chest pain unrelated to physical activity, persistent neck and right shoulder pain, and feelings of anxiety, stress, and depression. He mentioned that his memory isn't as good as it used to be, but finds relief from anxiety with his medication. Quin also has a scheduled heart test coming up.

His doctor has examined him thoroughly, noting that his blood pressure and pulse are within normal ranges, and his physical examinations for the neck, shoulder, and other areas show some limitations and soreness but no severe problems. The doctor diagnosed him with a frozen right shoulder and arthritis in his neck and shoulder. They have recommended exercises to improve the range of motion and discussed ways to adapt to the changes brought on by aging and his health conditions. They spent a significant time discussing how to manage his anxiety and depression, advising him to continue taking his anxiety medication as needed, which has been effective for him.
