Litao Yan, a 26-year-old PhD student, came in for a regular check-up with no immediate health issues. During the visit, Litao expressed concern about two small moles he has observed on his left palm and finger for about a year, which have not changed in size. To address his concerns and ensure his overall health, the doctor has planned several tests. These tests aim to check Litao's blood sugar levels and overall health, including a special test for his blood's fat levels, given his last year's report showing high cholesterol. In addition, because of Litao's worry about the moles on his hand, which appeared to be unusual but not alarming upon examination, the doctor recommended seeing a skin specialist for a closer look. This approach is both a precaution and a way to ease Litao's concerns by providing professional assessment and advice on the next steps.
