The patient, a 67-year-old man, came in because of chest pain. He has a history of heart disease from narrowed arteries, which led to a heart attack about five years ago, and heart failure, partly due to heavy drinking in the past. Recently, he stopped taking his heart medication, leading to increased heart palpitations and shortness of breath when active or even at rest. However, he reported no vomiting, sweating, pain spreading to other areas, changes in bathroom habits, or coughing.

During the check-up, he appeared awake, alert, and calm, with no signs of immediate distress. The doctor's examination showed no alarming signs. His heart was beating fast, and a heart test showed patterns often seen in someone with decreased blood supply to the heart but were not new compared to his last test. His specific heart enzyme levels were normal. The emergency department gave him medication to manage his heart rate. He was diagnosed with ongoing chest pain due to his heart condition, high blood pressure, and a fast heart rate and was kept in the hospital for more tests to figure out the best next steps.
