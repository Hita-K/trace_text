A 78-year-old man, who has had heart problems before, felt chest discomfort throughout the night and into the next morning. After a workout the day before, he experienced some chest discomfort. However, the discomfort and breathing troubles persisted, leading him to take nitroglycerin tablets (a medicine that helps by increasing blood flow to the heart) This action relieved his symptoms, prompting him to visit his doctor and then being sent to the emergency department for more checks.

Upon examination in the hospital, he appeared to be breathing normally and did not show signs of heart failure. Tests showed a pattern in his heart's electrical activity that was consistent with his previous condition, suggesting no new changes. After discussing his case, the doctors concluded that his heart condition might have gotten worse, possibly because of unstable areas in the arteries of his heart that were not getting enough blood flow. This could be happening without obvious symptoms because of his specific heart pattern. Pending further tests, it was decided he needed to stay in the hospital for more care. He was admitted in stable condition, with a diagnosis of worsening heart issues related to his known heart disease.
